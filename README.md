#Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Spark-Streaming-And-Kafka

In this project, we will learn about processing live data streams using Sparkâ€™s streaming APIs (Spark stream introduces concept of DStream(Discretized stream)a Dstream is nothing but streams of RDD where one RDD holds one time of data i.e. 1 batch=1 RDD) and Python. We will be performing a basic sentiment analysis of realtime
tweets. In addition,
you will also get a basic introduction to Apache Kafka, which is a queuing service for data streams.
